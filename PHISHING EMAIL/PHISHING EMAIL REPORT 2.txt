PHISHING INDICATORS IN THE MAIL:


1) FAKE EMAIL SENDER:
	Comes from helps@officesupportonline.com, which has a nothing to do with
facebook. This is not a official mail.
	Official Facebook emails usually comes from @facebookmail.com or a similar 
verified domain.

2) URGENT AND THREATS:
	User fear tatics 'your account will be deleted !' and 'within 48 hrs'.
	This is classic social engineering meant to pressure you into clicking quickly
without thinking.

3) GAMMAR MISTAKES:
	"deactived" instead of "deactivated".
	Weird sentence structure "Attention to your actions."
	These types of error are common by in phishing emails created by attackers
in a rush or non-native speakers.

4) SUSPECIOUS LINK:
	 The link is masked to look like it’s from Facebook:
https://www.facebook.com/01oix2/posts/102106376025783 
However, phishing links often use real-looking URLs that redirect you to malicious websites or cloned login pages
It could also be a trick using Facebook’s open redirect vulnerability.

5) NO REFERENCE TO ACTUAL ACCOUNT:
	There is no username, post content, or profile ID mentioned.
	Legitimate emails from platforms like Facebook include more details.

6) GENERIC MISTAKE:
	Starts with “Hi Dear User” — not personalized.
	Real services like Facebook use your full name in official emails.
